Color Reducing App -- useful for anyone trying to do image analysis

Author: Timothy E. Riedel 
Date: Fall 2013, updated Fall 2014
Goal: Take a picture and do some kind of analysis on it.

Summary:  This app takes a photo (or loads one from device) and displays the photo on an HTML5 canvas.  In a second canvas the photo is redisplayed with an algorthym that attemps to transform the colors within the original photo into basic primary colors (ROYGBIV). The algorithm doesn't work very well with shadows, greys, whites, and blacks.  It also seems to have a problem with green.
